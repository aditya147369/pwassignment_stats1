    "Ans. Statistics is a field of science where we collect, organize, and analyze data. Here, data refers to information about something, and by analyzing this information, we gain insights and make informed decisions. For example, if we have the weights of 5 people, we can use statistical techniques to obtain meaningful insights, such as the average weight (mean), maximum and minimum weights, from the raw data.\n",

    "For a dataset x = [45, 67, 65, 77, 91], to calculate the mean weight, we add all the data points in x and divide by the size of x (which is 5). The mean weight is 69. Similarly, there are other techniques like median, mode, etc."

    "Ans. There are 2 types of statistics: \n",
    "\n",
    "1.Descriptive Statistics - In this, we organize and analyze the population data and obtain meaningful insights in a descriptive manner, like a summary of data to make decisions. In this type of analysis, we make use of measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode), measurement of dispersion, covariance, and correlation. For example, descriptive statistics can be used to find the mean (average) of people's weight, height, etc., or find the middle weight or weight with maximum frequency in the dataset. We can see how much data is spread or how much the data varies around the mean using measures of dispersion. We can analyze the relationship between x and y variables using covariance and correlation.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Inferential Statistics - In this, we organize and analyze sample data, which is a subset of population data, and make conclusions about the population data. For example, suppose 55 people out of 100 are tested with a vaccine, and the cure efficiency is 90%. Here we have tested the vaccine on a sample of the population dataset, and we have concluded that we have gathered evidence that the vaccine will maybe have 90% cure efficiency for all the remaining people."

Here, we use different techniques like measurement of central tendency (mean, median, and mode), measurement of dispersion (to understand the spread of data and how data points vary from the mean, using variance and standard deviation), and tools like histograms to analyze the distribution of data values in terms of the frequency of each data point\n",

Similarly, these techniques can be applied to analyze students' weights in school, the performance of stock indices like the Sensex in India, and more\n",
